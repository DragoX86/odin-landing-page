# Odin Project Assignment #2 - Landing Page:
This assignment requires me to re-create a web page from scratch, closely following [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s design, while demonstrating what I've learned about Flexbox.

## Challenges I Encountered and How I Solved Them:

### Challenge 1:
Trying to get header-links (one, two, and three) to be aligned in a row centered to the top right

#### Solution:
The culprit that prevented the header links from being a row was `<ul>` in index.html, removing it solved the issue.
